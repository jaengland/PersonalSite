                    </div>
                    <p>As a Senior DevOps Engineer, I've been deeply involved in shaping and implementing
                        technical designs as part of a Scrum team, specifically for the global AWS account
                        provisioning program as well as the global Employee Identity and Access Management
                        program. My expertise lies in developing Integration Middleware and administrating
                        of enterprise web infrastructure. </p>

                    <p>My work has also involved deploying AWS resources by developing Infrastructure as
                        Code (IaC) using Terraform. I wrote scripts and modules from the ground up to deploy
                        diverse and extensive infrastructure and dependencies. Additionally, I managed REST
                        APIs and integrated API gateway with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB, using Swagger docs for
                        documentation. </p>

                    <p>I have a strong background in developing and maintaining templates for the rapid
                        creation and deployment of new microservices and other resource repositories. My
                        proficiency in Python is showcased through the libraries, classes, and functions
                        I've developed to automate AWS resource provisioning, configuration, and data
                        collection. I ensure all my Python code adheres to PEP8 standards, using tools like
                        flake8 and pylint for consistency. </p>

                    <p>My approach to developing Terraform and Python solutions is grounded in iterative
                        improvement, evolving projects from proof of concept to minimum viable product and
                        beyond. I'm diligent about writing and maintaining automated unit and integration
                        tests with pytest to ensure the highest quality in releases. </p>

                    <p>In my free time I enjoy exploring and photographing County, State, and National parks
                        and wilderness areas.
